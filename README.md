## Question: Do neonicotinoid insecticides have unintended consequences?

### About the study
Study was conducted in United States to collect the information on impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees. In study researchers investigated the effects of neonicotinoids on the sperm of pollinating bees.

Study how the pesticide treatment affected the count of live sperm per half milliliter of semen.

### Tasks to perform
* Extract the data from source and Clean the data
* Exploratory Data Analysis of the Data
* Bootstrap hypothesis test on bee sperm counts
